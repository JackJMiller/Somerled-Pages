## About

Somerled Pages is a family encyclopedia framework that allows genealogists to easily collect and present their research. The encyclopedia is created through the use of markup files which transpile to HTML articles, making it easy to navigate your family tree and share with others. Articles relating to entities other than people (such as places and lineages) can also be created.

A tutorial will be made available after the first stable release. Documentation will follow.

## Vision

Somerled Pages is intended to be a complete system for collecting and presenting research. The end result will have the following features:

- Custom Build: Users can define custom builds which will transpile only selected pages. This allows the user to share only the articles that they wish to share with that build's viewers. This is a privacy feature.
- Family Tree Interface: A family tree is rendered using the family relationships defined in the articles. This will allow users to view the relationships between different individuals and also to select articles visually by selecting members on family trees.
- Curated Homepage: Content can be selected for display on the homepage. This can include a description of the encyclopedia, featured articles, featured trees, an on-this-day-on-history section, etc. The homepage may be unique to each build.
- PDF Creation: The markup can transpile to PDF via LaTeX to allow users to present their research in the form of a book.
- Search: Users can search for articles according to keywords and include search criteria such as date of birth, place of death, surname, etc.
