<b>Francis James Braidwood</b> was a successful cabinetmaker in [[Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] and co-owner of the upholstery company <i>Braidwood & Bruce</i>. He was the father of the famous firefighter [[James Braidwood|James_Braidwood]] and was said to be the first person in Edinburgh to wear shoelaces.[f] He was the four-times-great-grandfather of [[Mary MacDonald|Mary_MacDonald]].

# Early Life

Francis was born around 1752 to [[William Braidwood|William_Braidwood]], a candlemaker.[j][l] He was apprenticed to cabinet-making.[b] He moved to London as a young man.[m]


# Career

Francis returned to Edinburgh some time around 1775. At the time, he was a joiner, cabinet-maker, upholsterer and undertaker. From London he brought with him a wide assortment of woods that would allow him to produce inlaid furniture. He moved into a Luckenbooths warehouse formerly owned by Young and Trotter, two well-known upholsterers that were operating in Edinburgh.[m]

With his business partner Alexander Bruce, Francis ran an upholstery shop <i>Braidwood & Bruce</i> at South Bridge Street from 1784 to 1804.[d] The company was not heard of after 1805.[e] In 1806, the warehouse was acquired by William Henderson.[n] 

On 10 November 1807, at around three or four o'clock in the morning, a fire was discovered at Francis's workshop at the Pleasance, near the head of Arthur's Seat. Intervention could not be made on time and so the fire consumed the workshop.[f][b]

Francis was a successful upholsterer who hired workers. In around the year 1810, Francis's workers went on strike to demand higher wages.[c]

A notice appeared in the Caledonian Mercury on 4 April 1814 announcing the bankruptcy three days earlier of an upholsterers company, Braidwood and Giles, which appears to have been owned by Francis.[i]

Francis removed himself to Adam Square. He was a captain of the Edinburgh Volunteers.[b]

After much success working in upholstery, Francis decided to enter into quarry work, and contracted for buildings in both Scotland and England.[b] Francis constructed King's College Bridge at the University of Cambridge. Despite finding a lot of success as an upholsterer, he was not successful in this new industry.

# Family

Francis had at least one brother — [[William|William_Braidwood_1]] — and at least one sister.

In 1796, his sister married Forrest Alexander. Francis and William viewed this marriage with contempt due to Forrest's position as a low shoemaker. Knowing of their view of themselves as "some pumkins", Forrest was well aware of their attitude towards him. Forrest went on to found the Commercial Bank of Scotland, a predecessor to the Royal Bank of Scotland.[h] Despite any scorn that at some point appears to have existed, Francis did go on to co-operate with his new brother-in-law in professional matters.

On 23 July 1775, Francis married Janet Mitchell at Tolbooth Church. Janet was the daughter of Andrew Mitchell, a brewer in the south of Leith.[g]


# Personal Life

Francis was elected Deacon of the Wrights in 1795 and Deacon Convener the following year.[b]

He was a keen golfer and the chaplain of the Edinburgh Burgess Golfing Club. He was also a member of the <i>Spendthrift Club</i>, a group of men who enjoyed walking after church services. The name was given to them in reference to their frugalness.[b]


# Death

Francis died 19 December 1828 in Edinburgh.[a] He left two daughters and two sons. His two daughters remained in Edinburgh, while James settled in London, and William in the United States.[b]

Other notes

The home Francis moved to in Adam Square went on at some point after him to be occupied by Messrs Dalgleish and Forrest.[b]
